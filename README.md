# 📊 Customer Purchasing Behavior Analysis  

## Portfolio Description:
This project analyzes the UCI Online Retail dataset to uncover customer purchasing patterns and insights. Using Python and SQL, I performed data cleaning, explored top products and customers, analyzed monthly revenue trends, and segmented customers using RFM analysis. Visualizations and actionable insights are included to support data-driven business decisions.

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project analyzes the **UCI Online Retail dataset** to understand **customer purchasing behavior**.  
I used **Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQLite3)** for data cleaning, SQL queries, and visualization.  

The goals of this project are:  
- Identify top customers and products  
- Analyze monthly revenue trends  
- Segment customers using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis  
- Generate actionable insights for business growth

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies  
- **Python**: Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, SQLite3  
- **SQL**: SQLite for queries  
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For analysis and visualization

## 📊 Key Insights  
- 📈 **Monthly Revenue Trend**: Shows seasonal peaks in sales.  
- 🛒 **Top Products**: A few products contribute the majority of revenue.  
- 👥 **Top Customers**: A small group of loyal customers drive high sales.  
- 🎯 **RFM Segmentation**: Customers classified as **loyal, frequent, or high-value**.
